# Employee Promotion Prediction

One of the problem our corporate world is facing is around identifying the right people for promotion (only for manager position and below) and prepare them in time. The traditional process is, first identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance. Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, an employee gets the promotion.
